# Phonetic Songs
Repo of tools developed as part of the Phonetic Songs project for transcribing song lyrics in X-SAMPA

1. Get song lyrics
    * Get songs from Billboard Hot 100
    * Get songs and lyrics from VocaDB
2. Rough conversion from words to Arpabet (w/ CMUDict) to X-SAMPA
3. Have humans correct the transcriptions https://discord.gg/wBAAub6
4. Use final transcriptions for fun projects, like statistical analysis or UTAU reclist generation
